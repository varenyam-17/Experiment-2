# Experiment-2 Operaotrs in CPP
## AIM:
To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)
## Theory:
### C++ Data Types
In C++, data types define the kind of value a variable can hold, allowing the compiler to allocate appropriate memory and manage data efficiently. These are the building blocks of all computations and logic in a C++ program.

### Here’s a breakdown of the fundamental data types:

- int: Represents whole numbers without decimal points.

- float: Handles numbers with decimal points, suitable for precision up to 6-7 digits.

- double: Similar to float, but provides double the precision and size.

- char: Stores a single character, enclosed in single quotes.

- bool: Contains one of two values: true or false, used primarily for decision-making.

- void: Indicates the absence of any value; commonly used to specify that a function doesn’t return anything.

## Conclusion
In this exercise, we explored the foundational structure of a C++ program, with special emphasis on data types. Each data type plays a critical role in how information is stored, processed, and interpreted by the program.
