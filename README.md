# Experiment-2
AIM:To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)
Theory:
C++ Data Types
- int – Integer numbers (e.g., 1, -42)
- float – Floating-point numbers with decimals (e.g., 3.14)
- double – Double-precision floating-point (more accurate than float)
- char – Single character (e.g., 'A', 'z')
- bool – Boolean values (true or false)
- void – Represents "no type" (used for functions that return nothing)
